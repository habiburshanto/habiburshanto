Hi, I’m Habibur Shanto, a Full-Stack Web Developer and Shopify Expert. I specialize in building scalable web applications and high-performing Shopify stores that help businesses grow online. My focus is on creating solutions that are clean, secure, and efficient, tailored to the unique needs of each client.

I work with modern technologies like MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for custom web apps, and leverage Shopify’s platform to deliver e-commerce stores that convert and scale. Whether it’s building a full-stack application from scratch, customizing a Shopify store, or integrating APIs, I aim to provide solutions that are practical, reliable, and future-ready.

I hold a background in BSc in Computer Science & Engineering, which gave me a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and systems thinking. Beyond technical skills, I’m passionate about learning continuously, staying up-to-date with modern web technologies, and exploring new ways to optimize both performance and user experience.

I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions, and I thrive when working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and strategically. My approach combines technical excellence with a results-oriented mindset, ensuring that every project I work on not only functions well but also drives real business impact.

My goal is to help startups, businesses, and entrepreneurs succeed online by delivering high-quality, scalable, and secure web products. I am also expanding my expertise into web security and DevOps, so I can provide end-to-end solutions—from development to deployment and maintenance.

If you’re looking for a dedicated developer who can bring your ideas to life with precision, creativity, and professionalism, I’d love to collaborate and help your business grow online. Thank you
